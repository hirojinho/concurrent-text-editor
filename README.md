# Concurrent Text Editor

To bring together all the paradigms you've learned into one cohesive project, a distributed real-time collaborative application would be an ideal challenge. This project will allow you to use multiple paradigms, languages, and techniques in a meaningful way, while simulating a real-world system where different components need to communicate and work together.

## Project: Distributed Real-Time Collaborative Note-Taking Application

This application will allow multiple users to collaborate on a set of notes in real-time, with features like version control, live chat, user roles, and a recommendation system for users based on their editing patterns. Each part of the system will employ different paradigms to reflect their unique strengths.

### Key Components:

1. Real-Time Collaboration & Chat (Event-Driven, Concurrent, and Actor Model)
2. Version Control for Notes (Functional, Logic Programming)
3. User System (OOP)
4. Recommendation System (Declarative, Reactive)
5. Data Storage & Analytics (Declarative, Imperative)

### 1. Real-Time Collaboration & Chat

- **Paradigms**: Event-Driven, Concurrent, Actor Model
- **Languages**: JavaScript (Event-driven), Go (Concurrent), Erlang (Actor-based)

#### Description:
Users will collaborate on a document in real-time, with changes instantly synchronized across all connected clients. You will implement concurrency in Go to handle multiple users editing at once and use an event-driven system in JavaScript to manage client-side updates. Erlang (or Elixir) can be used for the backend server, where each user is an independent actor communicating via messages.

#### Tasks:
- Event-Driven: Use JavaScript to create a live front-end where document changes trigger events (like WebSocket updates).
- Concurrency: Use Go to handle multiple clients connecting to the server and submitting edits simultaneously, ensuring that race conditions are avoided.
- Actor Model: Use Erlang/Elixir to model users and document versions as independent actors.

### 2. Version Control for Notes

- **Paradigms**: Functional Programming, Logic Programming
- **Languages**: Haskell (Functional), Prolog (Logic)

#### Description:
This component will manage document versioning, allowing users to track changes, revert edits, and merge updates. Functional programming with Haskell ensures immutability for document states. Prolog will be used for conflict resolution during merges, inferring the best way to reconcile user changes based on rules.

#### Tasks:
- Functional Programming: Use Haskell to model document edits as immutable snapshots of state. Every change creates a new version, and the system allows users to roll back to any previous state.
- Logic Programming: Use Prolog to manage complex merge scenarios by defining rules for conflict resolution. For example, rules might specify that edits from higher-privileged users override those of others, or that most recent edits take precedence.

### 3. User System

- **Paradigms**: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Language**: Java

#### Description:
Create a robust user system where users have roles (e.g., admin, editor, viewer) and permissions. Each user is an object with attributes like role, permission level, and activity logs.

#### Tasks:
- Implement classes and inheritance to model users and their roles.
- Use interfaces and abstract classes to handle user actions like editing, viewing, or managing users.
- Ensure encapsulation and abstraction in the user management system.

### 4. Recommendation System

- **Paradigms**: Declarative Programming, Reactive Programming
- **Languages**: SQL, Scala (with Akka Streams or RxJava)

#### Description:
Build a recommendation engine that suggests notes to users based on their editing patterns and document contents. You can use a declarative SQL query system for extracting user behavior data from a relational database. For handling live data streams of user edits and dynamically updating recommendations, use reactive programming in Scala.

#### Tasks:
- Declarative Programming: Write complex SQL queries to gather analytics data (e.g., most edited documents, top contributors).
- Reactive Programming: Use Scala with Akka Streams or RxJava to process real-time user interactions and generate personalized recommendations based on current activity.

### 5. Data Storage & Analytics

- **Paradigms**: Declarative (SQL), Imperative (C)
- **Languages**: SQL (for queries), C (for low-level data manipulation and optimization)

#### Description:
Store all document data and user activity in a relational database using SQL. Implement analytics queries for generating reports (e.g., which documents are edited the most, activity trends). For performance-critical parts, such as fast data retrieval or processing large datasets, write low-level data-handling code in C.

#### Tasks:
- Declarative: Use SQL to define data schemas and create queries that generate insights on document usage and collaboration patterns.
- Imperative: Implement efficient data retrieval algorithms in C to handle database optimizations (e.g., caching, indexing) and ensure that queries are processed quickly.

### Technological Stack Overview:

| Component | Paradigms Involved | Language/Technology |
|-----------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Real-Time Collaboration | Event-Driven, Concurrent, Actor | JavaScript (Front-end), Go (Concurrency), Erlang (Actor Model) |
| Version Control | Functional, Logic Programming | Haskell (Functional), Prolog (Logic) |
| User System | Object-Oriented Programming | Java |
| Recommendation System | Declarative, Reactive | SQL, Scala (Akka Streams/RxJava) |
| Data Storage & Analytics | Declarative, Imperative | SQL (Storage), C (Low-level optimization) |

### How to Bring it All Together:

1. **Modularization**: Each part of the system will operate independently. Modularize the project so that each component can be built and tested individually before integration. For example, the user system should be separate from the version control system.

2. **APIs & Communication**:
    - Build APIs for interaction between components (e.g., user system and document system, real-time collaboration, and version control). Use RESTful services or gRPC to allow the different language components to communicate.
    - Use WebSockets or similar technology for real-time event-driven communication between the front-end and back-end.

3. **Concurrency & Scalability**:
    - Use Go's concurrency model to handle multiple users collaborating at once.
    - Erlang's actor model will ensure that the system remains distributed and fault-tolerant.

4. **Data Pipeline**:
    - Real-time data streams from user edits can flow into a recommendation system built using reactive programming in Scala.
    - Use SQL to periodically generate reports or analytics from the stored data.

5. **Integration**:
    - Use Docker containers to host each part of the system in isolation.
    - Deploy with Kubernetes to ensure scalability and load balancing, as different components (like the real-time server) may require more resources than others.

### Final Project Deliverable:

You will have a distributed, real-time collaborative note-taking application that leverages multiple programming paradigms, where:

- Real-time changes are managed using concurrency and event-driven programming.
- Document versioning is handled with functional programming and logic-based conflict resolution.
- A robust OOP user system manages roles and permissions.
- A recommendation system suggests notes based on real-time data, leveraging declarative and reactive principles.
- Data is stored in a relational database and optimized with low-level imperative techniques for performance.

This project will help you experience the best of each paradigm and understand how different approaches complement each other in a large, distributed system.
